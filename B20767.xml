            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE To all the Militant Saints, and true Followers of Christ the Captain of our Salvation.</head>
            <p>DEar hearts, you are the proper Patrons of this poor Piece: Now it is Marched forth into the wide World, it can expect Shelter and Sanctuary from none but you. Should it happen to fall into its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Quarters, the <hi>Papists,</hi> &amp;c. they will give it no Quarter, but will use it worse than an Enemy. It makes bold for to Travel abroad without any Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, but its own Word. Do not make it a Let-pass, and send it Home for want of a Better. Though the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise be like the Author, a Stranger and Pilgrim in his own Countrey; yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat it well, entertain it, though but for a Night. <hi>Let Brotherly love conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to unbolt the Door; and than be not forgetful to entertain Strangers, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by some have entertained Angels una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.</hi> Let Truth be as welcom as
<pb facs="tcp:204446:6"/> any man on Earth, or as any, or all the Angels in Heaven. Its Errand is to save your Souls from the Fire of Hell, and that is better than to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from the Flames of <hi>Sodom.</hi> The Treatise, like many a Soldier, rides out a Scouting, on a low Horse, and with mean Apparrel, but with good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and Weapons; for it wears the Armour of God; And like a Master-Fencer, teacheth the use of the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Weapons of our Warfare, which ate the best in the World. And en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth, and directeth to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful performance of the most Critical, Difficult Cross-bearing, and Self-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Service for Christ. If you ask me, why I sent it forth into the Field, and Mount it on the Stage, seeing so many valiant Worthes are there already, and entered the List? I must tell you, That the Field is free for every Soldier, and I look upon it as my duty, to do Service for my Captain at his Call, so well as another. And Christs Service will be never the worse done, because per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by many hands.<note place="margin">Dr. Goudge. Mr. Gurnal, c.</note> Divers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Rich men have cast Millions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lords Treasury already, out of their abundance of Coin of the same
<pb facs="tcp:204446:6"/> Stamp, and yet there is room enough for my poor Mite to come after, and <hi>Rome</hi> doth call for it at this time. The best Preachers and Printers, are but Starrs of the first Magnitude, in the Right hand of the Son of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and shine in a borrowed Light from Him. And why should not lesser Starrs in the lowest Orb, shine in their Spheres, to give light to this dark World, when enlightned with the same Sun? And why should not a despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Glow-worm on the Earth, shine to shew the glory of his Creator, so well as great <hi>Saturn</hi> the highest Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Planet? I am willing my Light should be put out, like the Starrs in the Morning, so as the Sun might take place, and shine all day: And wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to shine in my borrowed Light, though at never so dark a Mid-night of the Militant Church. So that Christ may Encrease, I am content to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease: Though some are for Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing of the Service, and the Pay in this World, yet I shall endeavour to perform my Duty to God, as my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and to Christ, as my Captain; and through Grace, intends to put in for the Portion of a Child, for the Pay

            <p>Again, I know not how near my Glass is run, and how soon the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the Evening will overtake me: And I have spent a great deal of time about a Little, little Work, I would now put on a Holy, and Coveteous, and Ambitious frame, to double dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and do much in a little time, for my great Master; To spread Truth a great way, many wayes, and to many men at one time.</p>

               <hi>tempus breve, That Artis long, and time is short.</hi> The Christian may say so here. The Art of well-learning the Lesson of the Cross, is a long Art, and the time of Preaching or bearing of the Cross is but short. He desires now to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Tomb, whilst others are build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Tabernacles; and to Perfume his Name and his Grave with Truth, before he lies down in the Dust.</p>
            <p>The Captain of our Salvation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his Name was as Odoriferous Oyntment poured out, yet he had need of Precious Oyntments of <hi>Spike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> very costly, to anoint him whilst alive, to prepare him for his Death, and Myrrhe, Aloes, and much Spices, to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm him, and keep him sweet in the Grave.</p>
            <p>And some of his followers have need of Salve for the same Sore, that they be not buried alive, nor stink when dead. Again, the great <hi>Apostasie</hi> of many Professors, yea, and great Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers too.<note place="margin">Rev. 12.3.4.</note>
               <hi>The long tail of the Beast full of Apostate wandring Starrs, that are fallen from Heaven,</hi> and swept away already, and the shaking of many more. The Timerousness, the Temporising, the
<pb facs="tcp:204446:8"/> Cowardise, the Fearfulness and False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the Morosity and Bitterness, the Mutining and Malice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is among the Saints.

The Danger that Christs Interest is in, and the little Valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for the Truth upon the Earth. The doubts and fears that many labour under about the right manner of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping God, and the backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of many to lend their great Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to light the little Candles. These, and the like, have wet my Pen with Ink, my eyes with Tears, and extorted these lines from me.</p>
            <p>Fellow-Soldiers, and Christians, may it do you any Service, take it amongst you, such as it is. <hi>Silver and Gold I have none to give, but Truth is better, and such as I have, give I unto you.</hi> I have, through Grace, freely received, and I freely give. The Captain of your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation hath given you himself, his Body, his Blood, his Soul, his Spirit, his Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:204446:8"/> his Armour, his Truth, his Light, his Life, his Love, his Peace, his Prayers, his Grace, his Glory, his All. So all that I have, and am, in him, from him, and through him, do I tender to you, to live, and to dye with you, and for you, in, and for the Truth. I shall not anticipate any part of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise here, nor bring forth any of the Furniture of the House, to adorn the Porch. An <hi>Engineer</hi> will not make a great Sconce to a little Fort, nor many Flankers to a short Line; but will keep to <hi>Geometrical</hi> and <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Proportion. And now fellow-Soldiers, and Saints, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended this Treatise to you, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to the great Shepherd of the Sheep, and the Captain of our Salvation, before whom we shall all appear at the General Muster, and Randezvous at the great Pay-day, when Saints Militant and Triumphant, God, Angels and Men, shall all meet together at once. Let us so fight the good fight of Faith, and be Faithful in the Warfare of the Lamb, that we may see one another with comfort then; and to most of you I say, Farwel, Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, until that day.</p>

            <p>THE Title of this Epistle tells us who was the Author of it, and to whom it was principally written. And by the Epistle it self we are inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when, and from whence.</p>
            <p>It was written by <hi>Paul,</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.17. &amp; 1.18.</note> when he was a Prisoner there in the bonds of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> was a Prisoner several times, as well as when he wrote this Epistle; <hi>In stripes, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonments,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.5.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Pluralist in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Stripes and Imprisonments, but not in reference to his Benefices and Livings. <hi>I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>

               <hi>The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done, is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the Sun. Peter</hi> and the other Apostles were imprisoned; they were put in the Common Prison, for about 1600 years since. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet was put into a Dungeon, sticking in the Mire; and divers others of the Prophets were Prisoners and Captives some hundreds of years before the Apostles times; and the Lord Jesus Christ revealed to his servant <hi>John, That the Devil should cast some of the Church of</hi> Smyrna <hi>into Prison.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> was a Prisoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ready to be beheaded by <hi>Nero,</hi> then did he direct and encourage <hi>Timothy</hi> to prosecute vigorously the Interest of Christ and the Gospel. Christs Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters should be like <hi>Sampson,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sampson</hi> in this was a type of <hi>Christ.</hi>

Christ pulled down the pillars of Satans king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when on the cross. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.18.</note> and was nearest his death; then he pull'd down the Pillars of the house, and did the greatest Exploits. And so the servants of the Lord, when they are most restrained, and nearest their end, should strive to pull down the Pillars of Satan's Kingdom; and do greatest exploits for the Kingdom of Christ. None struggles and wrestles so hard for life, as the dying man; and so the dying Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and dying Saints, should above all others, and then above all times (when the time of their departure is at hand) have the strongest pangs and strugling for Christ and the Gospel. Their last works should be their best works. The Lord Jesus commends the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> that her <hi>last works were better then the first.</hi>

               <hi>Pauls</hi> bonds did sound at <hi>Casar</hi>'s Palace, and were manifested there, and in all other places; and the Brethren were confirmed, and waxed the more bold; and the word was preached without fear. The words of Christs Prisoners are next memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and affecting to the words of a dying man. The Prisoners are Martyrs in a degree, and so they spread the truth. So that great Persecution we read of at the death of <hi>Stephen</hi> the Deacon,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>The Gospel gets ground by Persecution. When <hi>John</hi> was banished into the Isle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> then did the Lord Jesus discover those glorious and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious truths contained in the Book of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> which neither himself nor the Churches, before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But now to hasten to my Text.</p>
            <p>In the whole Epistle are these four things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Inscription.</item>
               <item>2. The Introduction.</item>
               <item>3. The Subject matter.</item>
               <item>4. The Conclusion.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Text is contained in the Third of these, <hi>viz.</hi> The Subject matter of this Epistle.</p>
            <p>The Apostle having directed and exhorted <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> unto a faithful and industrious discharge of his Ministerial Office, both towards those that were without, and towards these that were within; he takes it for granted, that the faithful discharge of his duty in the work of the Gospel, would necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily expose him to much hardship, persecution and affliction, as well as it had himself; and thence perswades him to hold out, and endure whatever befalls him.</p>
            <p>In the Text are considerable Three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Duty.</item>
               <item>2. The Motive.</item>
               <item>3. The Manner.</item>
            </list>
            <p>First, A Duty which <hi>Paul</hi> presseth here upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> and that is, To <hi>endure hardness.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:204446:12"/>
            <p>Secondly, The Motive to it. And that is taken from his Relation to Jesus Christ, as his Soldier, <hi>Timothy,</hi> thou art a Soldier of Jesus Christ; thou hast entered and listed in his service, and thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice may be hard. Do thou therefore <hi>endure hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, because thou art his Soldier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The manner of performing this duty. <hi>Endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</hi> Do thy duty, endure the hardness of thy service, as a good Soldier ought to do:</p>
            <p>So that in the words you may take notice of these two things:</p>
            <p>First, Something plainly supposed. And here are these two things supposed, and taken for granted:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Timothy</hi> is a Soldier of Jesus Christ. <hi>Paul</hi> makes use of that Title, and that Relation to Jesus Christ, as a Soldier, to press him to his duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the discharging of his duty to Jesus Christ, will expose him to hardness.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is something plainly expressed; and that is, that he must <hi>endure</hi> the hardness which is incident to that Relation and Employment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou therefore endure hardness as a good Soldier of Jesus Christ,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall briefly open these two things in the words, and then give you forth the Doctrinal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, which I intend to prosecute.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What we are to understand by being a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:204446:12"/>2. What it is to <hi>endure hardness</hi> as a good Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>The first is taken in Scripture either Properly,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Miles.</note> or Metaphorically.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When it is taken Properly, it is understood for a person that is employed in Military Affairs, and bears Military Arms, and is under Military Command and Pay. So was the Centurion and the Soldiers under him. Matt. 8.9. <hi>For I am a man under Authority, having Soldiers under me; and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When it is taken Metaphorically, then it is to be understood of a Christian that is engaged and exercised in the holy Warfare of a Christian Profession under Jesus Christ, to follow him as his Captain-General in the Militant Church. And so by way of allusion and analogy, he is called a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, Because he hath his spiritual Combats and Conflicts; and the life of a Christian is a life of trouble and hardness, as the life of a Soldier is; and so we are to understand by Soldier in the Text.</p>
            <p>And then the title of Soldier is not to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated, or applyed only to any sort, or all Gospel-Ministers; but indefinite, and in common to all true Christians. The title of Soldier is not a discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating title, to distinguish Gospel-Ministers from others, as the titles of <hi>Ambassador, Pastor, Evangelist, Elder</hi> and <hi>Bishop</hi> do: Which are titles appropriated to their Office: So that <hi>Timothy</hi> is not called a Soldier (so much) because he is an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist, as because he is a Professor of Christ;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:204446:13"/> or at least not only because an Evangelist.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To endure hardness as a good Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
               <hi>Endure hardness.</hi> The word signifies, not to be afflicted only, but patiently to abide all kind of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and injuries with a Christ-like spirit, as the Captain of our Salvation did endure hardness, and bare affliction. But more of this in the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>And now I am arrived at these two Doctrinal Conclusions, which lie visible in the words.</p>
            <p>

            <p n="1">1. I shall speak to it by way of Proof and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By way of Use and Application.</p>
            <p>I shall demonstrate the truth of the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in these following Conclusions.</p>
            <p>First, Every true Christian is called and chosen by Jesus Christ unto his service. John 15.19. <hi>If you were of the world, the world would love his own; but because you are not of the world, but I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> There was a time when the Disciples of Christ, and all other believers, were of the world, and under the Regiment of the Prince of this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:204446:13"/> world, but (through the riches of his Grace) he hath called and chosen them to his own service.</p>
            <p>And not the Apostles of Christ only are thus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and chosen to the service of Jesus Christ, but likewise all believers. Rom. 1.5, 6, 7. <hi>By whom we have received Grace and Apostleship for obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the faith, among all nations, for his Names sake. Among whom ye also are the called of Jesus Christ. To all that be in R me, beloved of God, called to be Saints.</hi> They are called to Christs ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and chosen to be his Soldiers. This you may see to be clear, comparing my Text with the next following verse.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.3, 4.</note>
               <hi>Paul</hi> had no sooner perswaded <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> to endure hardness, as a good Soldier of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; but presently directs him how to please Christ, who had chosen him to be a Soldier.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Every true Christian hath accepted of Christs service, and voluntarily listed under him. When Jesus Christ doth conquer, and encline the wills of poor sinners towards himself, they come away volunteers unto him, and list themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him.<note place="margin">Psal. 110.3.</note>
               <hi>Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> Others many times do press and force men into their service, and keep them by force when they have gotten them; but Jesus Christ brings over the <hi>wills</hi> of his Soldiers unto himself. It is said, 2 <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r.</hi> 8.5. <hi>But first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</hi> As Christ gives himself to believers, so they also give themselves unto him. That is a glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie of Jesus Christ, shewing how sweetly he brings over sinners unto himself. Isa 11.10. <hi>And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:204446:14"/>
            <p>Thirdly, Every true Christian hath his Arms and Weapons appointed him, and given forth unto him, by Jesus Christ. We may see the Christians Armory, a whole Catalogue of it, Eph. 6.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. There is spiritual Furniture and Armour for the Christian, <hi>Capapee,</hi> from head to foot; there is the whole, and the holy Armour of God.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies such compleat Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers all the body, and leaves no part unfenced.</note> There is the <hi>Breast-plate of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> to secure and safe-guard the heart, which is the chiefest place of all. And there is the <hi>Girdle of Truth,</hi> to fasten the Breast-plate, and gird about the loyns, for the strengthning of the body. And there is Armour for the feet, to secure them in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, that the Christian may stand secure, and march safe; <hi>Having your Feet shod with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Gospel of Peace,</hi> which some say is understood of Patience in enduring and holding out. There is the <hi>Helmet of Salvation</hi> for the head, and the <hi>Sword of the Spirit</hi> for the hand, and the <hi>Shield of Faith</hi> to carry before him, to save the fore part of the Christian.</p>
            <p>Here you see Christs Soldier in his Arms com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat; Here is Armour <hi>offensive</hi> and <hi>defensive,</hi> which Jesus Christ hath given forth to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, whereby he is fitred for any service, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with any Enemies whatsoever: Every truth of Christs word, and every grace of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is a part of the Christians Armour. Now what should the Christian do in Christs Furniture? why should he bear his Arms, if he were not his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Christian hath his Warfare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him, and his Enemies discovered to him, and is commissioned (with his Spiritual Weapons
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:204446:14"/> and Armour) to conflict with them. The Lord Jesu Christ hath commissioned every Christian to enter the <hi>Combat</hi> with all his Enemies, whether Foreign or Domestick, whether External or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, whether Secret or Open. There is no General in the world can have a more ample and universal Commission, then that which the Lord Jesus hath given to every Christian.</p>
            <p>First, There are Foreign and External Enemies, which are without the Christian, and they are to be reduced unto these four heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Prince of the world.</item>
               <item>2. The Men of the world:</item>
               <item>3. The Lusts of the world.</item>
               <item>4. The things of the world.</item>
            </list>
            <p>First, There is the Prince of the world, <hi>The great Dragon, the old Serpent, called the Devil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.9. Here are four sad Epathites given to this cruel Enemy of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church.</note>
               <hi>and Satan:</hi> The Captain-General of the Hellish Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, that makes War against the Lord Christ, and his Church; and every Christian hath a plenary Commission to enter the List, and engage and fight those Principalities and Powers, those spiritual wickednesses in high places. The Devil bids de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance, and proclaims open War against Christ and Christians, and all Christians are commissioned to the best of their skill, and the utmost of their power, to pur on their spiritual Furniture, and to resist the Devil, Eph. 6.11, 12. <hi>Put on the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the Devil; for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and power, against the Rulers of darkness of this world, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst spiritual wickedness in high places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, There are the men of the world,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:204446:15"/> who are the subjects of this Prince of darkness, the Soldiers of this Captain-General, the Militia of Hell, the Auxiliaries of the Devil, the Seed of this old Serpent.</p>
            <p>They have the same enmity in their natures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christ and believers, rhat is in the Devil. Joh. 8.44. <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the lusts of your Father ye will do; he was a murd r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r from the beginning.</hi> Now the Lord Jesus hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned every Christian (with his spiritual wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons) to conflict with them,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Jude 3. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with v. 4. It imports an hot and violent fight, and instant contention. <hi>Leighs Crit. Sac. p.</hi> 95</note> and to <hi>contend earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Faith which was once delivered unto the Saints; for there are ungodly men crept in una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,</hi> &amp;c. Ungodly men that do oppose truth and holiness; and with these (like valiant Soldiers) they must contend earnestly, they must hold fast truth and holiness, let the men of the world be never so much enraged against them, to hate, malign, and persecute them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is the lusts and wickedness of the world. <hi>The whole world</hi> (saith <hi>John</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) <hi>lieth in wickedness.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 5.19.</note> And as the whole world of the unregenerate lieth in wickedness, so there is much of that wickedness also, that lieth in, and dwelleth in the Heaven-born ones themselves;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jam. 4.1.</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</note> they have their <hi>lusts that war in their members;</hi> and the believer is to oppose and resist all sin in the highest degree. Not only to avoid evil, <hi>but the very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil.</hi> The word signifieth a shape or representation of a thing, rather then the thing it self. The shape or image of sin is to be avoided as a dangerous enemy, whether extrinsecal or intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, whilst 'tis but in the Embryo, in the bud or blossom; when sin is but in its appearance,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:204446:15"/> every Christian is to appear against it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There are the things of the World, both adverse and prosperous; the one against the Christian by threats, menaces, and dismal frowns; and the other by treacherous smiles, and fawning insinuations; and both these are dangerous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to a Christian. The Apostle musters up a whole Army of these; The Afflictions,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.35, 36</note> Crosses and Persecutions of the world, as being got into the open field, and drawn up in Battalian against Believers. <hi>Tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sword, killing all the day long, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</hi> The Lord Jesus, the Captain-General of our salvation, was pursued by the afflictions of the world.<note place="margin">Isa. 53.3.</note>
               <hi>He was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f;</hi> and herein he did lead the Van, and left an example,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.21.</note> that Christians should follow his steps.</p>
            <p>And for the prosperous things of the world, they have their hooks and snares hid under their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant baits; and their flatteries and allurements are more dangerous then the former, because they lye more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ccult and secret; they come like <hi>Judas,</hi> with their <hi>Hail Master,</hi> and betray: And like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah</hi> to <hi>Sampson,</hi> to fawn and flatter on them, to find out their strength, and cut it off. The riches, honours, and pleasures of the world, have their snares and stings. <hi>They that will be rich,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.9.</note>
               <hi>fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in perdition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that part of the world that the Devil tempted the Lord Jesus withal, when he shewed him all the Kingdoms of the world,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.8.</note> and the glory
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:204446:16"/> of them. And so the Devil and Corruption works by these to duck-coy and ensnare the Saints. Many sinners are utterly destroyed by worldly prosperity. <hi>The prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 1.32.</note> And whereas Adversity (with <hi>Saul</hi>) slayeth his Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, Prosperity (with <hi>David</hi>) slayeth his Ten thousands. It destroyeth the wicked, and it pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, woundeth and endangereth many a Saint.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and lastly. Every true Christian is under the absolute and indispensible Command of the Lord Jesus Christ. When he commissioned his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples to preach and baptize, they were to teach, That all Christs Commands should be observed▪ <hi>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I command you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 28.19, 20 John 17.8.</note>
               <hi>I have given them the words which thou gavest me, and they have received them.</hi>

                  </gap> with a price.</hi> He bought and redeemed all true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers with the price of his own blood, to his own service; and so he commands them upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the Title he hath to them, and the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest he hath in them. He hath more then the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-right unto them, they are his by Purchase; the Lord Jesus hath redeemed them from the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bondage, captivity and slavery of Sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that they should be his own, and serve him for ever. <hi>That we being delivered from the hands of our Enemies, might serve him without fear, in holines<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and righteousness before him all the days of our life.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:204446:16"/>
            <p>Much more might be said, for proof and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the truth of the Doctrine; but summ up the particulars of what hath been said, and the total will amount to enough to pass this for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undoubted truth, That every true Christian is a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>I shall come now to improve and apply the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And I shall speak but to one Use of this Doctrine, and so pass to the next:</p>
            <p>Which shall be to exhort Christs Soldiers to observe his words of Command, and to acquit themselves as good Soldiers of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Put on, and handle your spiritual Arms.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The first Word of Command.</note> This is the first Word of Command in Military Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and this is the first of Command of Jesus Christ, your great Commander and Captain-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that I shall press upon you. And take it in the Scripture-dialect and form of sound words, as the Apostle hath it, Eph. 6.11, 13. <hi>Wherefore take unto you, and put on the whole Armour of God.</hi> Put on all your spiritual furniture, every grace of the spirit, not only in the habit, but in the exercise, life and power: Do not think it enough that you put on the habits of Grace; you must put on, and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Grace in its exercise. A Soldier is but little the better that he hath Arms delivered him, if he do not handle them, and use them; and so it is with a Christian.</p>
            <p>And here let me mind you of these Three things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That you see that it be true Armour of God that you do put on. There is a great deal of false, counterfeit Armour in the World, take heed that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:204446:17"/> you be not cheated with it: There is the Armour of common Gifts, and common Grace, which hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites put on and handle; but you must put on special saving Grace, that accompanies salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>those better things, and things that accompany salvation,</hi> which the Apostle speaks of; that is, those things that Apostates and Hypocrites never had, notwithstanding their splendid gifts, and rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parts. Ah Christians! look that you put on, and handle that Faith which overcomes the world, which <hi>John</hi> speaks of, 1 John 5.4. <hi>And this is the Victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.</hi> Look that you take unto you the right <hi>Shield,</hi> the right <hi>Breast-plate,</hi> the right <hi>Helmet,</hi> the right <hi>Sword,</hi> &amp;c. See that your works are wrought of God, that they are perfect before God; be sure it is the truth of God, and the holiness of God. <hi>Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.12.</note>
               <hi>and let us put on the armour of light.</hi> Take heed that you be not cheated with Armour of darkness instead of Armour of light; do not put on counterfeit Grace for true: And the Errors of Antichrists forging, and Humane Invention, for the true Armour of God. No Armour is safe, but what is of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Put on, and handle all your Arms. Put on, and exercise every Grace, and every Truth; every Grace of the Spirit of Christ, and every Truth of the Word of Christ, is a piece of spiritual Armour, and all must be put on; <hi>the whole armour of God</hi> must be put on; and therefore add one Grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, until you have put on all Grace: <hi>Add to your faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 5.6, 7.</note>
               <hi>vertue; and to vertue, knowledg; and to knowledg, temperance; and to temperance, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and to patience, godliness; and to godliness,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:204446:17"/> brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, charity.</hi> Never leave adding, and putting on of Grace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you have put on and exercised all Grace.</p>
            <p>And so put on likewise every Truth of God; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your selves with Grace and Truth, from top to toe: Satan is a skilful wartier, a cunning fencer, and he will make his play where he hath most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to harm you: If the <hi>Helmet</hi> be not put on, a Soldier may be wounded in the head, and if the <hi>Breast-plate</hi> be not on, the Christian may be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the heart. Put on every truth, and every Command of Jesus Christ, and herein you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit your selves the Soldiers, yea the friends of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. <hi>Ye are my Friends if you do whatsoever I command you.</hi> Yield the same subjection to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, as the Centurion's Soldiers did to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.9. <hi>And have Soldiers under me, and I say to one go; and he goeth, and to another come, and he cometh; and to my servant, do this, and he doth it.</hi> O Brethren and Soldiers of Christ! do you likewise be at the beck and check of Christ; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and obey every truth of Christ, that the Lord Jesus may not complain of you, as he did of those Complemental Professors; <hi>And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I say? Luk.</hi> 6.46.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Put on, and use every piece and part of your Spiritual Armour, in its right and proper place; you have Armour for every part compleatly fitted (where you have need to wear it, and use it) and for every time and occasion when you have need to exercise it. Put on and exercise every grace in its proper place and time, this is the duty, the beauty, and safety of Christs Soldiers; <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.12.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:204446:18"/>
               <hi>Rejoycing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing constant in prayer.</hi> Sometimes a Christian hath need to exercise one grace, and sometimes another; and sometimes divers graces at once.</p>
            <p>Sometimes Faith is the bearing and most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grace to be used; and above all you must put on Faith,<note place="margin">Eph. 6.16.</note>
               <hi>the S ield of Faith;</hi> above all, the shield of Faith must be put on: Sometimes Patience, and then you must <hi>in patience possess your Souls.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.10.</note> and then, <hi>Here is the patience and the faith of the Saints.</hi> Sometimes Love is the bearing-grace,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.3.</note> and then the Commandments of Christ are made easie. Sometimes the grace of Joy is most proper,<note place="margin">Jam. 5.13.</note> and sometimes godly sorrow. <hi>If any among you be afflicted let him pray; is any merry? let him sing Psalmes.</hi> And so put on and exercise every truth of Christ in its proper place and season.<note place="margin">Prov. 25.11.</note>
               <hi>A word fitly spoken, is like Apples of Gold in pictures of S lver. I have many things to say unto you</hi> (saith Jesus Christ to his Disciples) <hi>but ye cannot bear them now.</hi>

When the Prince of this world made an onset on him, how did he answer every Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a suitable<note n="*" place="margin">It is written.</note>
               <hi>Scriptum est?</hi> He put on truth in its proper place and season, and so overcame the Devil: And so the Soldiers of Christ must exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise and use the sword of the Spirit as their Captain-General hath shewed them. Ah Christians! put your Graces in exercise in their proper places; and so put on, and exercise truth in its proper place: Put on truth in the heart as well as in the head; the heart is the most proper place for the Word of God. <hi>The Word must be received into good and honest</hi>

            <p>A Church (saith Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi>) may be a true Church of Christ, yet it may be such a Church, that perhaps you, nor I, nor another cannot have Communion withal.

            </p>
            <p>Well, I shall suppose this to be the particular Case, and indeed, it is so with some.</p>
            <p>That whereas there is the sign of the Cross (with other things) mingled in Baptism; and one, after all right means used for his informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cannot be satisfied in his Conscience, but that it is the mark of the Beast received in the

               </gap> by way of eminency; yet, he thinks it to be a mark of the Antichristian Beast, because it did never come from Christ, neither is it any of the marks that the great Shepherd puts on his Sheep. Another comes to the Lords Supper, and there he sees an Idolatrous Priest to bow down to, and worship a wooden board, and sees him make a God of that, which was made of mens hands, and his Conscience tells him that 'tis like bowing down unto <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's</hi> Image, and he cannot eat with him at the Lords Table, lest he should be partaker of the Table of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils also. Another he cannot receive the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the hands of the Priest, except he kneels down and takes it on his knees; and his Conscience tells him, in case he should submit to it, he should be guilty of betraying the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious liberty of the Gospel, the price of Christs invaluable Blood. Another cannot bring his Conscience to joyn with them in Publick, in hearing, and Praying, fearing lest his presence should encourage and harden others in their Apostasie, formality, and Idolatry, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come partaker of other mens Sins, as well as his own,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.22.</note> contrary to that of the Apostle. <hi>Be not partaker of other mens Sins.</hi>

            <p>I will instance now in some things, which may not be far off from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Suppose that the Church should require of me that I must take an Oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or that I must subscribe to a Bishops Book of unscriptural Articles: Or that I must give my assent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to all things in the Common-Prayer-book, to be according unto the word of God: Or that I must own, that Prelates are of Divine right: Or that the Publick Meeting house is more holy than any other place: Or that the Surplice hath no Superstition in it, when the Priest do wear it, or that bloody <hi>Bonner</hi> and <hi>Gardner</hi> were as good as any, or most of our present Prelates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And my Conscience should tell me from Scripture, that it were a Sin in me to subscribe, or consent to any of these things.

            <p>Here now I will instance in particular. It is

            <p>Yea, it is the duty of a particular Church. Member (in a regular manner) to plead home, and witness against the sins of a whole Church.

But now if you should tell any of the truth to your Mother, she will Disinhetit you, Goal you, Banish you, cut out our Tongue, or kill you, if you tell the truth, Now if you cannot do your duty, let your Mother alone in het Lewdness, only grieve for her in private, and pray the Lord to mend her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Let me conclude this duty with that emphatical Exhortation of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 15.58. <hi>My beloved Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, be ye stedfast, unmovable, alwaies abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the work of the Lord.</hi>

            <p>First, Lay in, and lay up a good stock of precious Promises. There are Promises suited to every condition, for the worst of times; Oh that you would grasp them in, and lay them up! they will be a foundation for your faith to build on,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.17, 18, 19.</note> and for the Author of Hope to fasten on, and will be sure and stedfast in the greatest storm; the promises will be as the Cork to the net, as the Ancor to the Ship in a storm, as a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Refuge to the Man-slayer. There is one Promise that is more worth than the world, be sure to lay it up; Psal. 84.11. <hi>The Lord God is a Sun and a Shield, he will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he with-hold from them that walk uprightly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Store up your former Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that is a precious provision for an evil day; call to mind, with the Psalmist, your <hi>songs in the night, and the years of the right hand of the Most High.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119.52</note>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label>
               <hi>That it is the duty of Christs Soldiers to endure the hardness of that relation, in their Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in prosecuting of this Truth, I shall shew you these four things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>What hardness this is that Christs Soldiers must endure.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Why they must endure it.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>How they must endure it.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>The use that may, and should be made of this Doctrine, unto our selves.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>First then in general. Christs Soldiers must endure all that hardness, which either their sins, or their profession of Christ, may expose them unto.</p>
            <p>The sins of Christs Soldiers may expose them to much hardness, to great sufferings, and that must be endured. <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mic. 7.9.</note> saith the Church. And so likewise there is much hardness of affliction and persecution, which their profession of Christ, and duty to him, doth expose them unto; and that must be endured. <hi>Whosoever doth not bear his Cross,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 14.27.</note>
               <hi>and come after me, cannot be my Disciple.</hi> There is no entring Christs Service, without bearing his Cross. The Christian, saith <hi>Luther,</hi> is a Cross-bearer:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:204446:42"/> And godly <hi>Bradford,</hi> that blessed <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> in his Letter to the Town of <hi>Walden,</hi> saith, That he hath not learned his <hi>A. B. C.</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, who hath not learnt the Lesson of the Cross. <hi>Yea, all that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, And more particularly, They must endure hardness,

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First, That hardness which comes more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the hand of God, must be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured. Though the Lord hath his hand, in some sense, in all the Afflictions and Sufferings of his people,<note place="margin">Amos 3.6.</note>
               <hi>and there is no evil in the City which the Lord hath not done;</hi> yet there are some evils of suffering, which come immediately, and only from the hand of the Lord; And <hi>David</hi> in that sad choice of his, did rather choose to fall into the hands of God, than into the hands of Men; The Pestilence was an immediate stroak of Gods hand: All the bodily afflictions which God inflicts,<note place="margin">Psal. 91.5, 6, 7</note>
               <hi>The Terrour by night, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that flyeth by day, and the Pestilence that walketh in darkness, and the Destruction that walketh at noon-day, &amp;c.</hi> All Diseases, Pains, Poverty, Losses and Crosses, which the Lord brings upon our Bodies, and all the lashes and wounds he makes in our Souls, the hardest of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:204446:42"/> all afflictions, must be endured, if the Lord lays it on us. <hi>A wounded Spirit</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) who can bear?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 18.14.</note> If Christs Soldiers do meet with Soul-wounds, and Spirit-wounds, though never so grievous, yet they must be born. What hard service was that which <hi>Heman</hi> did endure! as you may see at large, <hi>Psal</hi> 88.14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Lord, why castest thou off my Soul? why hidest thou thy face? &amp;c.</hi> This hard Service did <hi>Job</hi> endure, when <hi>the Arrows of the Almighty</hi> did enter his Soul. This hardness did <hi>David</hi> endure, when he complained of the breaking of his bones. And this hardness did the Lord Jesus himself, the Captain of our Salvation, endure,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>If the tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the whole world, and Hell it self, were mustered together, they were nothing to this whereby God sets himself contrary to his poor creature.</p>
               </note> when he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me?</hi> And so much of this hard Service as he ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ls his Soldiers unto, they must endure. In a word, all the Corporal and Spiritual Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which God brings upon us, during the time of our life, and the separation of the Union of our Soul and Body by Death; The last Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the King of Terrors, must be faced; the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Death must be endured, this earthly Tabernacle must be put off, (as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed us) 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Soldiers of Christ must endure that hardness that comes from men. And there is a Two-fold hardness which must be endured from men.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This hardness did did those Champions and Frontiers endure. The Lord Jesus doth not use courtship and flattery, to complement sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers into his service with promises of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, riches, ease, and prosperity, as many other Commanders do: But he tells them the worst of his service at first, he tells them of the Cross,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:204446:45"/> before the Crown and Reward;<note place="margin">Luk. 19.23.</note> and we must take up the Cross as it comes, it must be taken up daily. What, every day a Cross to be born? I hope then it is not heavy, some may say? Yes, as heavy as death,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.31.</note> it is a killing-Cross; <hi>I die daily</hi> saith <hi>Paul.</hi> But then, you may suppose, if it must be an every daies, and a killing-Cross, that there will be some intermission or refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment some time or other in the day:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.36.</note> Not so neither, <hi>For thy sake are we killed all the day long.</hi> Killed at morning, killed at noon, killed at night, killed every day, and killed all the day long; <hi>alwaies delivered up to death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.10, 11.</note>
               <hi>and bearing about the dyings of the Lord Jesus.</hi> Ah Soldiers of Christ! this is part of your Warfare; this hard service, this dangerous Cross-bearing, Killing, Dying duty, must be performed whensoever you are put upon it, and as much of it as the Lord Jesus shall call you unto; These skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, these sharp fights of persecution, you must endure. The Apostle tells the believing. <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10.32.</note> that they <hi>endured a great fight of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Christs Soldiers must expect to endure great fights of affliction and persecution from men. This is another part of their hardness, they must endure when call'd unto it by Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Soldiers of Jesus Christ, must endure hardness from the Devil. They must expect hard service, and hot service in entring the List, and fighting the Duel; in grappling and wrestling with those <hi>Principalities and Powers, and Spiritual wickedness in high places.</hi> It is hard service to wrestle with a roaring Lyon; how
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:204446:45"/> much more harder to wrestle with an enraged Devil. To wrestle with a Lyon, is but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with flesh and blood; but Satan is a potent, powerful Spirit. The Devil is skilful in Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, the hottest hardest, and most dangerous service of all; the Apostle tells Christs Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>the fiery Darts of the Devil.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 6.12. Eph. 6.16. The Devil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of Malice, sets himself, as an Enemy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord and his creatures. And for this cause he is named in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Satan, that is Fiend, an adversary, enemy, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sister. He is called also with his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>Shedim,</hi> that is, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, for the hurt which they do, prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Creatures, and spoiling them.

What a cruel Dart was this cast, for a God to worship a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil▪
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:204446:46"/> Ah Soldiers of Christ! you must expect to endure such kind of hardness as this from the Devil: Sometimes temptations to presumption, sometimes to despair, sometimes to question the Attributes of God, sometimes the word of God, sometimes the works of God, sometimes the very being of God: you must endure the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these soul-piercing and burning Darts. It was hard service that <hi>Scanderbag</hi> had, in his War against the <hi>Turk;</hi> but Christs Soldiers have harder in the Warfare of the Lamb against the Devil. Christians, if you are good Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Christ, you can more or less experience the hardness of this service, the Devil will not let you be alwaies quiet.</p>
            <p>The Devil left Christ ('tis said) for a season: It seems he intended to make an onset again.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Christs Soldiers must endure hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with a more special relation unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And here is a threefold hardness to be endured, upon this account:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The hardness of self-denyal, in parting with worldly enjoyments when called for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The hardness of Mortification, in cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying internal corruptions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The hardness of their particular places and stations.</p>
            <p>First, There is the hardness of self-denyal, in parting with the best, the nearest, the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and choicest of our outward enjoyments, when the Lord Jesus calls for them; Father, Mother, Brethren, Sisters, Wife, Children, House and Lands, yea, and our very Lives also, or else we cannot be the Disciples and Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:204446:46"/> of Jesus Christ.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ye vince &amp; Mundus tibi victus est, &amp;c.</hi> overcome thy self, and the World is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered to thee.</note> This is hard service some will say: yet, if put upon it, it must be endured. The rich man mentioned, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.21, 22. could not endure so much as to hear of the hardness of this service, much less to perform it; <hi>He was sad at that saying, and went away grieved:</hi> This service of parting with all his Prossiessions, was too hard for him, he could not touch with it, notwithstanding all his seeming forwardness: This is harder than for a <hi>Camel</hi> to go through a needles eye; and yet, the Soldiers of Christ have endured it, and must endure it; <hi>Lo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 10.28. Heb. 11.8.</note> saith <hi>Peter, we have left all and followed thee.</hi> This hard service did <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful endure, in parting first with his own Country which is (as the Philosopher saith) sweet to all. <hi>By Faith Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Patriâ nihil dulcius.</note>
               <hi>when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an Inheritance, obeyed, and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</hi> The Lord bade <hi>Abraham</hi> depart his Country, and <hi>Abraham</hi> dayily submitted; never disputed the case whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he must go, or to what Country; or what accommodation he should have, whether an House, or a Tent to dwell in; but readily obeyed. And afterwards, this great Champion of the Lord was put upon a harder piece of self-denying service, in parting with his Son. <hi>By Faith</hi> Abraham, <hi>when he was tryed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.17, 18.</note>
               <hi>offered up</hi> Isaac, <hi>and he that had received the promise, offered up his only begotten Son, of whom it was said, in</hi> Isaac <hi>shall thy seed be called.</hi> What a piece of hard, self-denying service was this? to part with his Son, his begotten Son, his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:204446:47"/> Son, his <hi>Isaac,</hi> his laughter, his joy, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, the Son to whom the Promise was made, and the Nations of the Earth were to be Blessed in him? a Carnal Soul, and a cowardly Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er would have reasoned thus, Why Lord! take my Oxen, my Sheep, my Servants, but spare my Son; this is my <hi>Isaac,</hi> the joy and delight of my heart; this is my only begotten Son, this is all the seed I have by <hi>Sarah</hi> the free-woman, this is the Son of the Promise, there is none in the World that hath things of such concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment depending on him, as this Son of mine hath. What shall become of the Nations, which are promised to be Blessed in him? And if I must needs part with him indeed, that he must he Sacrificed, let it be done by some other hand, and not by mine: Why I am the Father that begat him, and he lies near my heart, 'tis like Death it self to think of h s Death; but for me to be the Butcher that must kill him, this kills my heart, in this one thing let me be spared; this setvice and duty is too hard for me.</p>
            <p>But Faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> makes none of these carnal Pleas, the command being given, he arose <hi>early in the morning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 22.1, 2.</note> and went readily about this hard self-denying service. Christs Soldiers have been put upon the hardness of self-denying service many a time, in parting with the nearest and dearest of their worldly enjoyments; And these things must be parted with if Christ calls for them, yea and hated too when they come in competition, or compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with him: This hardness must be endured, or else, you cannot be Christs Disciples or Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:204446:47"/>
               <hi>If any man come unto me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 14.26.</note>
               <hi>and hate not his Father and Mother, Wife and Children, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Sisters, yea and his own life also, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be my Disciple:</hi> Nothing below, is more dear than life, <hi>skin for skin, and all that a man hath, will he give for his life;</hi> and yet that must denyed and parted with.<note place="margin">Rev. 12.11.</note>
               <hi>They loved not their lives, unto the Death.</hi> It was a notable saying of <hi>George Carpenter,</hi> a <hi>Martyr</hi> of <hi>Bavaria: My Wife and Children are so dear unto me, that all the riches of the Dukedom should not purchase them from me: But for the sake of my Lord God, I willingly forsake them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cleopatra</hi> the last Queen of <hi>Egypt,</hi> invited <hi>Anthony</hi> to a Feast, at which she dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigar a Pearl prised at an Hundred <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stercies.</hi>
               </note> Shall <hi>Cleopatra</hi> dissolve her Jewel, worth thousands freely, and drink it up for the sake of <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> out of her wanton love; And can you love Christ truely, and not dissolve your choicest Jewels for him as willingly and freely? Shall others be so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to satisfie their Lust, to dissolve Jewels and Pearls, and shall you think any thing too dear to part with for Christ? When <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had Conquered the Country of <hi>Arabia,</hi> he sent a Ship-load of Frankingsence to a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-man of his acquaintance, and bade him serve the Gods plentifully, and not offer incense miserably. Ah Christians! shall Heathens serve their false Gods plentifully, and will you serve the true God miserably?</p>
            <p>Secondly. There is the hardness of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in the Crucifying of Internal Corruption. This service is too hard for the Hypocrite to endure: out-side easie service, that he will engage in; but as for this inward sin-crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duty, he will not touch it. The Carnal Jews
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:204446:48"/> would slay multitudes of Sheep and Oxen for Sacrifice, until the Lord complained of them; <hi>To what purpose is the multitude of your Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 1.11.</note>
               <hi>saith the Lord? I am full of the burnt-offerings of Rams, and the fat of fed Beasts, &amp;c.</hi> But then they would not slay one Sin; they were content to endure the hardness of the <hi>Circumcision of the Flesh,</hi> but for cutting off of the fore-skin of the heart, the <hi>Circumcision of the Spirit,</hi> that was so hard and painful, that they would not endure; The <hi>Circumcision that was made with hands,</hi> was smarting; but the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision that is made without hands, in putting off the Body of the Sins of the Flesh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 2.11.</note>
               <hi>by the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision of Christ,</hi> as the Apostle hath it; this is harder to be endured. If the cutting the stone in the bladder be so painful, what is the cutting of the stone in the heart? Ah Soldiers of Christ here is the hardest of all your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice within you, in Mortifying and Crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of innate Corruptions, this body of Sin, how hard is it!<note place="margin">Col. 3.5.</note>
               <hi>Mortifie your Members which are upon the Earth, &amp;c.</hi> The killing of Sin, is as the killing of the Members of the Body;<note place="margin">Mat. 5.29.30.</note> this is plucking out of right eyes,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> and cutting off of right hands; this is Crucifying-work, and Crucifying service is hard service;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Austine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. <hi>Non pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet transire per istas anguisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as. I</hi> do not love to pass through those straits.</note>
               <hi>I am Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed with Christ,</hi> saith the Apostle: The Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of the Natural Body, how painful and grievous was it? for the Body to be nailed hand and foot to the Cross, it was a painful, hard, and lingering death, that the <hi>Romans</hi> used to put their Malefactors to; and such is the Death of Sin in the Soul, it is set forth in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:204446:48"/> by the Crucifying of Jesus Christ; when the most beloved Lusts, the most pleasurable and profitable Sins must be nailed to the Cross, and be Crucifying with Christ, this is bloody, killing service, yet this Christs Soldiers must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; And not say to Christ,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.25, 26.</note> as <hi>Zipporah</hi> did to <hi>Moses, a Bloody Husband,</hi> a Bloody Captain <hi>thou art unto me, because of this Circumcision.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Christs Soldiers must endure the hardness of their particular Places and Stations, unto which they are called. Some Soldiers are called to harder service than others; the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn hope, and the Van, may meet with harder service than the main Body of the Army; The Frontiers and File-Leaders may meet with har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der service than the Rear; and the Watch-men that lie Purdue, and stand Sentinels, with harder duty, than those that abide on the Guard; some are expos'd to more hardships and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties than others, but every Soldier must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the hardness of that station where he is set, of that particular duty that is required of him. The Sentinel must not quit his Watch, and say, it is too cold to stand out, and the shots do flie thick, it is too dangerous being here; The File-leaders must not face about and fall back in the Rear, because the hardest ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is in the Front, there are the Wounded, and there are most Slain; The Leading Officers must not bid the Private Soldiers fall on, and themselves run away; The Colours are most shot at, yet the Standard-bearer, and Ensign must stand by them, and Display them in the face of the Enemy. And so it is in the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:204446:49"/> Church, the Lord Jesus doth call some o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his Soldiers to harder service than others: <hi>Paul</hi> was no sooner listed under Christs Banner, but he was put upon harder service than ordinary, to bear the name of Christ, before the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and Kings,<note place="margin">Act. 9.15, 16.</note> and the Children of <hi>Israel; I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my Names sake.</hi> To bear the Name of Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> and the <hi>Israelites,</hi> must necessarily expose him to suffer great things; yet, here he kept his station, and liv'd and dy'd in the duty he was commanded unto, and put upon: He bore the Standard of the Gospel, Preached Christ, converted Sinners, planted Churches, edified and confirmed Believers, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Whip often, and the Prison often, and laid down his life in Christs service at last. The Ministers of Christ are Officers in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant Church, and are put upon harder service than other Soldiers, and some of them call'd to harder duty, sometimes than others; but yet notwithstanding, they must do their duty, and take their lot.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.16.</note>

Pag. 170</note> Now they were to pass along by those places of <hi>Mizpah</hi> and <hi>Tabor,</hi> as they went in their journey, and there the King, and the Priests had set spies and watches, to insnare and intrap them, to catch them, and inflict pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:204446:50"/> upon them, for their not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> Idolatrous Worship. Well, the <hi>Prophet</hi> being called to this duty, he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth home the Priests, and lets flie at the King, and the Courtiers; and tells them, how that they were revolted from the true worship of God, and had laid their snares and nets, to catch the godly Non-conformists; and tells them, That their designs were profound, and laid deep for slaughter.</p>
            <p>And so the godly Non-conformists of the Tribes, would keep their course unto <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to Worship the Lord, as they were wont, notwithstanding the King, and the greater number of the Tribes were revolted, and the snares and nets that were laid for them, and the spies, and trapanners, which did watch for them in the way: Yet <hi>Jerusalem</hi> being the place of Worship, thither they would go; they would keep on their march, notwithstanding the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Ambush-cadoes, and dangers and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that were in their way. Ah Soldiers of Christ! wheresoever you are placed, you must endure the hardness of that station and duty unto which you are called. If your service be harder than it hath been formerly, or harder than others is at present, yet if put upon, you must endure it. I remember a passage I had from the mouth of a person of Honour, and Valour.<note place="margin">Gen: Blake.</note> Where (saith he) should a Minister die, but in the Pulpit? Ah where should Christs Ministers live and die, but where they are set, either in their Pulpits, or Pulpit-work, in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their proper stations? And so likewise
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:204446:50"/> all Christs Soldiers, are to endure the hardness of their particular stations whete they are set; whether as Superiors, or Inferiors, as Master and Servant, Parent and Children, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It was hard, and hot service which the Angel of the Church, and the Church of <hi>Pergamos</hi> were called unto, and dangerous standing where they were set; It was where the Devil did dwell, and where the slain did lie, and yet there they held it out. <hi>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satans seat is;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 2.13.</note>
               <hi>and thou holdest fast my Name, and hast not deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Faith, even in those daies wherein</hi> Antipas <hi>was my faithful Martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</hi> They were called to stand by Satans seat, at the Devils door, where Satan dwelt, and where <hi>Antipas</hi> was slain; and yet there they stood and held it out, at push of Pike (as it were with the Devil) in the midst of all the dangers and deaths that were before them.</p>
            <p>The Militant Church should be like the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Host, to fight in their courses. It is said, <hi>The Stars in their courses fought against</hi> Sisera.<note place="margin">Judg. 5.20.</note> The heavenly <hi>Luminaries</hi> are called an Host, not only for their number; but also, for their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they keep, like an Army well Martial'd. The Sun, Moon, and Stars, they all keep their own Orbs and Spheres, they keep their Courses, and perform their Revolutions in their several stations, although the clouds gather never so thick and black, and the greatest Eclipses, or darkest Nights come never so often. And so should Christs Soldiers, like these Coelestial
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:204446:51"/> bodies, keep their courses and stations, where they are set. O the gloomy daies, the thick clouds,<note place="margin">Act. 20.22, 23, 24.</note> the sharp showers that <hi>Paul</hi> did meet with! And yet like the Sun in the Firmament, he kept his course, and was resolved to finish it: <hi>And now behold, I go bound in the Spirit unto</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, <hi>not knowing the things that shall befall me there: Save, that the holy Ghost witnesseth in every City, saying, that bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of these th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> kept his Course, until he had finished his Course and his Ministry with Martrydom, and lost his Head on <hi>Nero's</hi> Block. And so should every good Soldier of Jesus Christ, endure the hardness of their particular places and stations where they are set, come what there will, or can, upon them.</p>
            <p>The Second thing to be spoken unto, is to give you the Grounds, or Reasons of this Truth, Why Christs Soldiers must endure hardness: And instead of many more that might be given, take these four following.</p>

And if there were no other reason to be given, this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:204446:51"/> one is enough to carry it against all the carnal Reason in the World, that can be brought against it. How often hath the Lord Jesus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the taking up of the Cross? How often hath the Lord Jesus, his <hi>Come after me, and follow me?</hi> And it is not for a Soldier to dispute the commands of his Capital Officer. The <hi>fiat,</hi> the <hi>Sic volo,</hi> of Jesus Christ, is enough against all the World.

Ah Soldiers of Christ! can you be content to wear the Crown of Gold, and Christ your Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the Crown of Thorns? Is it reasonable, that there should be such a disparity between Christ, and Christians, that Christ should have the Ignominy and Contempt, and you have all the Honour!

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:204446:53"/> do expose them unto: Because otherwise it would be a disparagement and dishonor unto Jesus Christ, if his Soldiers should not endure hardness, when it shall be said, that all other Soldiers will; that the Soldiers of Men, and the Soldiers of the Devil, will endure hardness in their service; and if Christs Soldiers should not endure hardness in his, how much would it reflect upon the Honour of Christ?</p>
            <p>There came a <hi>Centurion</hi> to Christ (a petty <hi>Roman</hi> Commander,<note place="margin">Mat. 8.9.</note> a Captain of an Hundred men) and describes the Valour and Fidelity of his Soldiers, what manner of Persons they were: <hi>I am a man under Authority, having Soldiers under me: And I say unto one, go, and he goeth; unto another, come, and he cometh; and to my Servant, do th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Here is a true Character of my Soldiers.</p>
            <p>Now we will suppose that the <hi>Centurion</hi> should desire an account of the Lord Jesus, concerning his Soldiers, in such a manner as this: Lord Jesus, thou art more than a man under Authority: Thou art a God above all Author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and art Captain-General of all the Forces, and Armies in Heaven and Earth; Thou hast

            <p>Ah! how sad is it to consider, what truth it self must say to this! True, may the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus say, I have many Soldiers under me: I command the Host of the Blessed Angels, those potent Creatures, and they obey me readily; they execute all my decrees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I have Soldiers upon Earth, in my Militant Church, of whom I cannot give so good a Character, as thou hast of thine.

At another place stands planted a whole rank of Ordinances and Acts, of several sorts and sizes: At this place lies Imprisonment; At the other place Banishment; and one step far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lies terrible Death, where no quarter can be ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ected; and here I cannot get my Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on. They say the service is too hard for them to endure. Oh Centurion! may Christ say, that I could give so good a Character of my Soldiers, as thou hast of thine! Oh that my Soldiers would go and come, and obey my
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:204446:55"/> Commands, and endure hardness, like thine.</p>
            <p>We will suppose again now, that the Lord Jesus should ask the Devil, concerning his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, in such a manner as this: Satan, thou hast Soldiers likewise; thou hast the most, and the worst in the World: How do they obey thy Commands? What hardness will they endure in thy service? Ah how sad is it here to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how that the Father of lies, may speak too much truth, to the dishonour of Christ!</p>
            <p>Why, Lord Jesus, may Satan say, I can tell thee of many Renagadoes, and Apostates, who have left thy service for the hardness of it, and have since endured hardness in mine. I can tell thee of many that have sickly bodies, hungry sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks, and naked backs, for serving me: I can shew thee many, that have ruined themselves, their families, and posterities in serving of me; in drinking, whoring, gaming, &amp;c. I have Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which do bear the marks of my service: Behold it, some on their fore-heads, some on their shoulders, others in their hands. My Soldiers obey my Commands, and endure any hardness that I put them upon; Stripes, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, and Death it self. They will adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the Whip, the Goal, the Gallows, yea, Hell and Damnation it self, in serving of me. Here are the Irons that stigmatized them; Here are the Ropes which hanged them; And though never so many are dropt already, I have enough to stand in their Places, and to take their Lot when I command them. I can shew thee a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and longer list of my Prisoners, than thou canst of thine: I can shew a greater book of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:204446:56"/> Malefactors that have suffered for me; then thou canst of <hi>Martyrs</hi> that have suffered for thee.</p>

               <hi>who offered themselves willingly among the people.</hi> And so the heart of Christ is toward those Soldiers that offer themselves willingly, unto his hard service; He cares not for Prest-Soldiers.

The Lord Jesus tells his Disciples, what hard service they should be put upon, How that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies shoul lay their hands upon them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute them, and deliver them up to the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues,</hi> and to the Prison; and that they should bring them before Kings and Rulers, for his Names sake, and how they should be betrayed, by Parents, Brethren Kinsfolk and Friends,<note place="margin">It is said of the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> that they were pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, Weather, and Wars.

The Captain of our Salvation hath March'd before us, and led the Van, and born the brunt and heat of the Day, through all his unparallel'd Agonies, Temptations, Afflictions and Persecutions, with admirable Patience:<note place="margin">Heb. 12.1, 2.</note> And so would he have us to March after him. <hi>Let us run with patience the race that is set bef re us, looking unto Jesus.</hi> It was a hard race which the Lord Jesus did run, and yet he ran it with Patience;<note place="margin">Isa. 53.7.</note> he did never kick, nor fling,<note place="margin">The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure the Ass, as a perfect symbol of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.</note> nor mutter, nor murmur. <hi>He was Oppressed, and he was Afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a Lamb to the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and as a Sheep before her shearers is dumh, so opened he not his mouth, &amp;c.</hi> And herein he left his Soldiers an Example that they should

            <p>Though Christs Kingdom is a Kingdom of Tribulation; yet, it must be a Kingdom of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. <hi>I John, who am also your Brother and Companion in tribulation, and in the Kingdom and Patience of Jesus Christ.</hi> We must be Patient, in this Kingdom of Christs Patience. How patient did <hi>Job</hi> bear it out, under all his Losses and Crosses, Temptations, Poverty and Sores? when he was the very picture of infelicity and misery, and the Proverb of poverty; yet, he was a Monument, and a Non-such for Patience.

               <hi>despising the shame.</hi> There was a great deal of shame, and ignominy, and reproach in the Cross; and yet Jesus Christ did slight and despise it, as if it had been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and so should his Soldiers likewise.</p>

The Apostle supposeth, that he may bestow his goods; not extorted and forc'd from him, but freely bestowed; and not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or some of his goods, but all his goods; and that to so charitable a use, as to feed the Poor, who are in necessity and want; And give his Body to be burnt, not pull'd and drag'd to the Stake, but voluntarily give himself to suffer such a cruel death as Burning; and yet all this to be without Charity, and without profit. What, may a man give all his goods, and yet have no Charity? and give his body to be burnt, in the cause of Christ, and yet not profited by it? This seems a Paradox, yet a great truth! all this may be done from Principles of self-love, of natural courage, osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, vain glory, &amp;c. without any sincere love to Christ, or his Interest and Glory. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> will part with much, and suffer much, to merit Salvation; The <hi>Romans</hi> have suffered death, that they might Immortalize their Names and Glory: The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were wont to say, That it is a shame for any man to fly in time of danger; but for a <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> it is a shame for him to deliberate.</p>

So <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> when they had received a Countermand from the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, forbidding them to Preach any more in Christs name; they would not observe it, but look'd upon the Call they had from their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Christ, to be valid enough, and made their Enemies to be Judges in the Case;<note place="margin">Act. 4.18, 19.</note>

            <p>Here is <hi>all perseverance</hi> in all prayer and all supplication (for so this totality doth grow big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and bigger, greater and greater, until it goes through all the Engine, and fastens the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts together) and this is to persevere, in keeping up the heart in life, in vigour, in heat, and in flame,<note place="margin">It is said, that <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> set himself to seek the Lord 2 Chron. 20.3.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:204446:76"/> unjust Judg, and the importunate poor Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Luk. 18.1. <hi>And he spake a Parable to them to this end▪ That men ought alwayes to Pray, and not to faint.</hi> As this poor woman did run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and follow this wicked Judg with impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate complaints and cries, so the Elect of God are said to cry till their prayers are heard, and their righteous cause be avenged.</p>
            <p>This is to put on a kind of holy Impudence, and offer an holy violence to the Kingdom of God. Like a <hi>Jacob,</hi> to cast forth his grapple, to hitch, and hold fast the Angel, though it were the Angel of the Covenant, yet he would assume the boldness to close in with him, and say (as it were) Now I have you, now you are my own, and I will have something of you before you go hence; and so struggles with Omnipotency it self, from the evening until the morning, till his thigh was bruised, till the day did break, and till the blessing did fall betimes, like the morning dew: Wrestle he would, and get the blessing he would, though cripled in the Contest. Like a <hi>Hannah</hi> in praying, in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness, and weeping sore for a Son, and not give over till she had a Son, and a <hi>Samuel</hi> too. Like a <hi>Jonah</hi> crying out in the belly of the Whale, as if in the belly of Hell, until bread comes out of this great eaters mouth, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness out of this bitter belly, and the great Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan delivers him safe a Shore.

Now one would think that this poor woman were quite blown up; that these words, like Arrows impoyson'd, had struck her dead: Well, struck down she was, but she scram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles up again, and skilfully bends the <hi>Engine</hi> of Prayer, and like a spiritual Politician, finds now a way to strike the Mark, when the standers by think it farthest off, and most at random.

There is something be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a Dog, let me have that: I will not sit down at the Table, to eat bread with Children; but will lie with the Dogs under-board, to wait when a Crust or a Crumb will fall.</p>
            <p>And being so low, and putting her <hi>Engine</hi> on the Ground, she gets into the very heart of Christ, and there she hits the Mark at last, and gains the price of Mercy, and goes home with Trophies of Victory over the Devil. <hi>O Woman, great is thy Faith! be it unto thee, even as thou wilt; and her Daughter was made whole from that very hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This is all Perseverance in Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and Prayer.</p>
            <p>All Perseverance in all Prayer, is always to pray in the Spirit. Perseverance must pass through this Totality likewise, in the <hi>Engine</hi> of Prayer.

There is often, <hi>Let us Pray,</hi> and yet when Priest, and Clark and People too, have took their parts, and united their strength, How imperfect is it, and far short of this <hi>All-Prayer,</hi> in the Text? Some say, that it is as Crutches for the Lame, and a good help to pray by: And to this I say, that there are two sorts of persons which make use of Crutches; The one out of meer necessity, and it were a piece of Cruelty and Inhumanity, for to deny a good Crutch to a real Cripple; But when the Crutch is more Cripled than the Man,<note place="margin">Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was that gave them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, be sure they had none from the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters, from the Captain General, Christ.</note> it will but deceive him, and lame him the more, by trusting unto it. And the Scripture, and the Spirit are the best helps in the World, to Pray by. But if Ministers cannot go without such Crutches as these, they are not fit for that Preferment, to bear Office so high in the Militant Church. But rather to be Degraded, if not quite Cashiered from the Army of Christ.</p>

            <p>There are another sort, who make use of these Crutches, that have been known to go well without them, (and as good at Climbing, as any in the Army) and it is not questioned by many, but they can go as well again, if these Crutches were but taken from them. Sirs, give me leave, to speak a word of Advice unto you; Take heed of Counterfeiting in such weighty matters as these. For it is no good mocking with such spiritual Edg-tooles, and spiritual Weapons; for fear lest the Lord should blast your Gifts, and Parts, and suffer your Graces to wither; and take away your Talents from you, because you improve them no better. It was a sad charge which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> brought in against <hi>Job,</hi> (had it been true) <hi>Job</hi> 15.4. <hi>Thou castest off Fear, and restrainest Prayer before God.</hi>

               <hi>Peter</hi> was cast into Prison, and into Chains in Prison; and the Church made that which is called a Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. They got together in private, and made Prayer without ceasing. And this <hi>Engine</hi> of Prayer broke down the Enemies Battery, blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up their Mine, and did their Work. Their Prayer went secretly to Heaven, and took a Courtier of the Throne by the hand, and brought him down to Earth, leads him into the Prison, unloseth the Chains, unbolts the Doors, and brings forth <hi>Peter.</hi> And the blessed Angel goes and steals upon <hi>Herod</hi> the King, and smites him down to the ground, and cuts him off with sudden and shameful Death. And he that was but little before, stretching forth
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:204446:85"/> his hand to vex certain of the Church, hath now the hand of God, and the hand of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel too, stretch'd forth against himself, to vex this Persecuting Prince to death. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this Sublimity and Grandeur, though on the Throne, and in Royal Apparel, and cryed up with a shout of the People, to be a God, and not a Man, yet he was made know himself to be but a vile persecuting wretch, and a great despicable stinking worm, and meat for the lesser worms to eat.

But they would not observe, but return to their company, report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was done, and sets their <hi>Engine</hi> of Prayer a going, to counter-work the Enemies rage. They spread the threats, the cruelty and rage of the Enemies, before the Lord in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, desiring the Lord to behold those threats; And at last, the Place where this <hi>Engine</hi> was set, did shake; And being cast into Prison, away comes the Angel secret by Night, and opens the Prison-Doors,<note place="margin">

Sometimes it goes off at a right level, point-blank, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at random. Somtimes it goes off through an absolute Promise, and sometimes through a conditional Promise, but always through a Mediator, and there it never misseth, or goes beside the Mark.

            <p>Oh! the Mystery of Prayer!</p>
            <p>This is one of the great Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, which the Mighty Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Polititians of the World understand not; and yet Babes and Sucklings have it revealed unto them. They have the hand that will turn the Cock above, and draw the sweet Wine of the Kingdom, to Cordial, and refresh the Opressed Saints; and to fill the Cup to the brim with the bitter, the red, the sparkling wine of Divine wrath, for all implacable, oppressing sinners. These Babes have the key of the Kingdom of Heaven, where the Treasures of Mercy and Wrath are laid up and reserved. A Praying <hi>Hannah</hi> can go up, and fetch down a rich Mercy for her self and the Church to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And a Child, or a woman may take this <hi>Engine</hi> of Prayer, as <hi>Jael</hi> did her hammer, and secretly smite a Nail home to the head, in the head of a <hi>Sisera.</hi> Prayer is sometimes like Hack Gun-powder, it will deliver home to the Mark, and do Execution before the Report is heard; and somet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mes like white Powder, that will kill the Enemy, or get the Prize, and make no noise in Earth at all. Like Lightning, that will Mysteriously penetrate the smallest pores: That will melt the Sword, and not burn the Sheath. Prayer hath much intimacy, and goes hand in hand with the invisible God: It can deliver an Arrow to the heart of a <hi>Julian,</hi> and strike a persecuting <hi>Apostare</hi> dead, in his Tent, and no mortal eye can see whence it came. This

It cries day and night; It cries continually, from Generation to Generation▪ It cries until the Cause and Quarrel of the Elect be Avenged; and the Mercies they cry for, he obtained.</p>
            <p>All these cries are up in the World, yea, and up in <hi>England,</hi> and that very high at this day. Though Prayer be look'd upon never so despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, yet it hath a loud and successful voice. Though it may be look'd upon by many to be but as the noise of Rams-horns, yet it will make the Walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> like the Walls of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico,</hi> to fall down. Prayer hath a loud breath, and a long breath, yea and a strong breath likewise. Though Prayer may sound no more than a Tear on Earth, yet it sounds as a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet in Heaven. And like some <hi>Engines</hi> that begins with a smoak, but ends with a sound. The Prayers of the Saints go up to Heaven with the smoak of Incense; but they make a report, and recoile with a loud eccho, and have voices as terrible Thunderings, and Lightnings, and Earth-quakes. Rev. 8.3, 4, 5. <hi>And another Angel came and stood at the Altar, having a Golden Censer, and there was given unto him much Incense, that he should offer it with the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all Saints upon the Golden Altar which was before the Throne. And the smoak of the Incense, which came with the Prayers of the Saints, ascended up before God, out of the Angels hand. And the Angel took the Censer and filled it with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:204446:89"/> Fire of the Altar; and cast it into the Earth: and there were Voices, and Thundrings, and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and an Earthquake.</hi> Let me a little open this Scripture, that you may the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how your <hi>Engine</hi> of Prayer comes to make such a Report, and to sound so loud.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Angel</hi> is understood to be the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, the true Angel of the Covenant; not a common and ordinary Angel, but a Covenant and extraordinary Angel. It is Jesus Christ that offers up the Prayers of the Saints.</p>
            <p>And He is the true Golden Altar himself,<note place="margin">

And then He, as our Great High Priest, carries them into the Holiest of Holiest, and layes them upon himself, the glorious Golden Altar that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne of God; and offers them up with his own hands,<note place="margin">When <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> came gainst <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuse</hi> with great Forces, <hi>Archimedes</hi> began to handle his <hi>Engines,</hi> and flew many kinds of shot, and stones of great weight, which sell with such exceeding noise and violence, that it beat back the <hi>Romans</hi> and brake down the Foundations of their <hi>Engines</hi> that was against them, &amp;c <hi>Clark.

            <p>The lower the <hi>Israelites</hi> lay in Bondage, in Affliction and Iron, the deeper did they sigh, the louder did they cry, the more grievous did they groan; <hi>And their cry came up to the Lord by reason of their Bondage, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly did the Lord remember them:</hi> And at last their Prayers and Cry redounded with the voice of joy, in a Jubile for themselves, and Judgment and utter Destruction upon <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his Army, their oppressing Enemies, which made the Sea to roar, and the Earth to ring with a mighty voice.</p>
            <p>The least sigh or sob, the least groan or moan, or tear of a gracious heart, makes a noise in Heaven. <hi>David</hi> knew it well enough, and therefore he is sometimes, with his Lord <hi>hear the voice of my weeping, the voice of my groaning, the voice of my moaning, the voice of my morning, the voice of my sighing, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great God makes much, yea he makes the most of the least of Prayer: When the Saints do but sigh on Earth in a Dungeon, he hears them on his Throne of Glory. When
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:204446:90"/> they do but sigh in the Prison, he hears it at his Palace. Ah Saints! what a God have you! that a sigh should sound so loud to be heard in Heaven, to awaken God, to rise him up, and to bring him down from the Throne to the Foot-stool, to help his oppressed People.<note place="margin">Psal. 79.11.</note>
               <hi>Let the sighing of the Prisoners come before thee; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the greatness of thy Power preserve those that are appointed to dye:</hi> Or, as the Marginal reading is, <hi>Preserve the Children of Death.</hi> Ah Prisoners of Christ, and Children of Death! what a Cordial is this, That your sighing may be heard in Heaven, to break your bonds, though Affliction and Iron, yea, though bound with the bonds of Death? It can reverse the Sentence from the Children of Death, upon whom it is cast.</p>
            <p>Jesus wept and groaned, and groaned again; and the groans were heard in Heaven: And he cryed out, and his voice was heard in the Grave, and the bonds of Death were loosed, and the Grave gave up her Dead.</p>
            <p>Ah Soldiers of Christ!<note place="margin">Gemitus op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressorum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>audit Deus.</note> learn of your Captain to weep and groan over another <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and it may bring him from the dead, though he have lain in the Grave-bound hand and foot, under a heavy Tomb-stone, more years than the former did dayes.</p>
            <p>Oh! go with <hi>Mary,</hi> and weep at the grave, till he whom thou lovest, and Christ loveth, come forth. The Prayer of Faith, though in sighs and groans that cannot be expressed, may cry loud enough to save the sick, and to raise the dead. What a precious Text is that, worthy
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:204446:91"/> to be written in letters of Gold! Psal. 12.5. <hi>For the oppression of the Poor, for the sighing of the Needy; Now will I arise (saith the Lord) I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.</hi> Or, as the Marginal reading is, <hi>From him that would ensnare him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ah poor and needy ones! are men puffing at you, and ensnaring of you? When you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not utter your complaints openly, yet you may secretly sigh out your Oppressions before the Lord, and that will be loud enough to awaken the Lord to arise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For with him the Fatherless find Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prayer is a Weapon, an <hi>Engine,</hi> which your Enemies with all their skill and power cannot take from you, or wholly hinder the use of it, as long as you live. Let a Saint have all his Books taken away, yet he can pray. Cast him into Prison with <hi>Peter,</hi> yet he can Pray. Cast bloody stones at him with <hi>Stephen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 7.60.</note> yet he can Pray in that dark storm. Stop his mouth with a gag, or a cloath, as some of the Martyrs were, yet he can sob, and sigh, and that is Prayer. Pluck out, or cut off his Tongue, as other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs were used, yet he will moan and groan, and that is Prayer, yea and loud Prayer too. The more men go to silence Prayer, the louder it cries; the more they go to stop, and damm up Prayer, the more it breaks forth and runs over, like waters, with a greater noise.</p>
            <p>Let out his Blood, and that will still speak, and cry with the Blood of <hi>Abel.</hi> Burn him to ashes, his dust will fly up to Heaven with the Martyrs, and joyn Forces with that blessed
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:204446:91"/> Army, and besiege the Throne of God, the Throne of Grace and Glory, with a loud voice, <hi>How long, holy and true,</hi>

               <hi>dost thou not avenge our Blood on them that dwell on the Earth?</hi> And all the Prayers they made in the time of their life, will reinforce their strength again, and follow them when they are dead.

            <p>Set your Praying-<hi>Engine</hi> a working to stop the March, and remove the misery of Poverty, which is come in, and coming on upon the Land like <hi>an Armed man,</hi> and that not only upon the sloathful and sluggards,<note place="margin">Pro. 6.11.</note> but upon the industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diligent also. The Trade and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory of the Land is sadly decayed: Many rich men are become poor already; many Masters are become Servants, many Wise men become Fools for want of money and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries to supply their occasions, and negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate their business. Many houses in which hath been found riches and plenty, now poverty and penury. Many faithful Ministers turned out of House and Home, out of Parishes, out of Cities, out of Towns-Corporate, and Five miles out of petty Burroughs too; many of them, with many Children, and more Debts, without any outward Estate of their own, or Fifths, Tenths, or Unites allowed them by others.</p>
            <p>Many poor men work for Brass, instead of Silver; and others would work for almost any thing, but cannot get Imployment, their Clothes lies at pawn, the Brass is sold to buy bread, and the Children cry for more when that is eaten. The Husbandman knows not how to pay his King his Royal-Aid, and his Landlord his
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:204446:101"/> rightful Rent, and live meanly with his poor Family. The Lenders have but little money, and the Borrowers less credit. Oh pity much, and Pray much for the Land, because of this, because of the misery of Poverty which doth so much already, and is likely more to distress and distract the poor Nation, your Mother-Countrey that hath brought you forth.</p>

Your Out-works, your Inner-works, your Ramparts, your Walls, your Bulwarks, your Forts and Towers, all your Defence is encouraging. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.20. <hi>A Fenced Brazen Wall.</hi> That is strong; where are any Walls of Brass, but about the Church? And yet behold stronger than Brass, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.1. <hi>Salvation will God appoint for Walls and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks.</hi> How safe must those be, that are Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about with Brass, and Fortified round about with Salvation? Brass is strong, and Salvation is stronger; and yet view well your Defence, and you shall find it to be stronger again, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.2. <hi>The Lord is my Rock, and my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress, and my Deliverer, my God, my Strength in whom I will trust, my Buckler, and the Horn of my Salvation, and my high Tower.</hi> As the Cause is greater, and better than the Effect, so is the Lord more stronger than Salvation it self. Let me speak in the Dialect of the <hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> 48.12, 13. <hi>Walk about Sion, go round about her, tell the Towers thereof, mark ye well her Bulwarks, consider her Palaces. Sion</hi> was a <hi>Type</hi> of the Militant Church, and her Towers, and Walls, and Bulwarks, was <hi>Typical,</hi> to signifie <hi>Mystical Sion,</hi> the Church of Christ. Now Soldiers of Christ, go round about the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:204446:107"/> Militant Church, and behold your Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, view your Works, mark well your Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, and you shall find them to be of Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible strength; and tell the Towers thereof that are for your defence. The Towers are so many, that you cannot easily tell them; yet mark them well, and count them if you can. All the Glorious Persons in the Trinity you may reckon for so many Towers; all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Names, Titles and Attributes of the blessed God-head, whether Communicable or Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable, whether Nominal or Real; whether Absolute or Relative; and there are near Five hundred of these, of the one, and of the other, in Scripture, and you may tell every one of these for a Tower and Defence for the Church.</p>
            <p>Again, count up the Glorious Promises of the Blessed God, that are of use, and in force, and you may write them down for so many Towers. Ah Soldiers of Christ! how strong must those Fortifications, those Walls and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks be, that have so many Towers to Flank and Defend them round about?</p>
            <p>At one Tower <hi>Truth</hi> Preserves; at another <hi>Omnipotency</hi> Defends; at another <hi>Wisdom</hi> Counter-Works all the Plots, and Mines, and Stratagems of the Enemies; at another <hi>Justice</hi> clears off the Enemies; at another <hi>Wrath</hi> breaks out upon them like Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At one Tower lies oppressing <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and his Potent Army, dead together; at another <hi>Lucifer,</hi> Son of the morning, that glittering Star <hi>Senacherib</hi> pluckt down from Heaven, and cast to the Earth;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:204446:107"/> at another Persecuting <hi>Herod,</hi> smitten, and gives up the Ghost.</p>
            <p>Ah! how Formidable and Terrible are the Attributes, Threatnings, and Promises of God to his Enemies! and how full of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and comfort are they unto his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! Oh how safe must they be, that have such strong Fortifications as these? What a most Emphatical Scripture is that, to set forth the strength of Christs Soldiers defence? <hi>Isa.</hi> 33.16. There is an <hi>Emphasis</hi> in almost every word; and it answers all Objections that may be made, against the security and safety of them that fear the Lord, in the worst of times. <hi>He shall dwell on high; his place of defence shall be the Munition of Rocks; bread shall be given him, his waters shall be sure.</hi> Their place of Defence is Munited and Fortified with Rocks; Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Rocks, Impregnable, Impenetrable, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessable Rocks, where the Pioneers can make no Mines to hurt; and it is so high, that no Scaling-Ladder can reach to the top of their Defence, they shall dwell so high; If the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my could make Ladders as long as <hi>Jacobs</hi> Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was, yet they could not Seale these Walls, they would be found too short to reach the top: For their place of Defence is as high as any thing in God.</p>

Ah Soldiers of Christ! what encouragement is here to hold out the Siege, when your Defence is so strong, and your Provision so sure?</p>
            <p>And among all your Strength, and Towers, mark well, and take special notice of your main Tower, and Castle-Royal, The Great Name of God. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.10. <hi>The Name of the Lord is a strong Tower; the Righteous runneth into it, and is safe.</hi> The Omnipotent Power of God to aid, to succour, to preserve, and to deliver his poor People: This was that strong Tower to which <hi>Moses</hi> did run, and was safe, when pursued by <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his Mighty Army. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. This was that strong Tower the <hi>Three Children</hi> took for their Defence, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. And let me tell you, That the Great Name of God is in some sense, of a larger extent than the Promises of God: The Promises of God doth assure us, what God will do; but when we look to the Great Name of God, there it is what God can do upon an Accompt of his Omnipotent Power, and Prerogative Royal. The <hi>Three Children</hi> had no particular Promise that they should not be burnt in the <hi>Fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace;</hi> but they looked to Gods Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and Almighty Power, and there they were
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:204446:108"/> safe. <hi>Our God whom we serve, is able to deliver us out of thy Hand, O King.</hi> When they had no particular Promise, they fled to, and pitched upon an Attribute, and they were safe. Oh what may not God do for his Great Name, when poor Creatures do make it their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge?</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventh Consideration: Though your Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber be the fewest, yet your side is the strongest: the strength of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is on your side, and that is Infinitely more than can be against you. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.14. <hi>The Lord shall Fight for you,</hi> said <hi>Moses</hi> to the <hi>Israelites;</hi> and how strong must they be, that God Fights for? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31. <hi>If God be for us, who can be against us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I have read of <hi>Antigonor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It is said of the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> that they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wont to enquire of the number of their Enemys, but where they were.</note> how that when some told him of the Super-numerous Army that was coming against him, and that he was under Number to Engage the Enemy; <hi>How many</hi> (said he) <hi>do you reckon Me to be?</hi>
               </q> If an <hi>Antigonor</hi> would be reckoned for many; how many may Jesus Christ be reckoned to be? What if the Militant Church be few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, One of a City, and Two of a Tribe; and there be never so many Legions of Devils, and Armies of wicked men against them? yet you may reckon Jesus Christ against all these, if they were a Thousand times more. <hi>Isa.</hi> 41.14. <hi>Fear not thou Worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel, I will help thee.</hi> If a poor despicable Worm, should take a Mote, and challenge the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the World to Fight them, as <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Pompeys,</hi> the great <hi>Turk,</hi> &amp;c. every one would look upon it as a ridiculous thing, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:204446:109"/> would conclude this Worm to be no match to Fight them; I, but if an Omnipotent God will march forth with, and take the part of this Worm, then all the strength of Earth and Hell will be too weak to Engage with this Worm. <hi>Fear not thou worm Jacob, I will help thee.</hi> Though thou art as weak as a Worm, yet I have the strength of a God, and who can stand against a God, and a Worm, when their strength is United? And then it is added in the next verse,<note place="margin">God is <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in the lest of all his Creatures.</note>
               <hi>Behold I will make thee a new threshing Instrument having teeth; thou shalt thresh the Mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the Hills as Chaff.</hi> God will help this Worm <hi>Jacob,</hi> and then shall he thresh down all the Mountains that stand before him!</p>
            <p>Ah Soldiers of Christ, though you be few and weak your Captain-General is of Invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble strength; and <hi>greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the World,</hi> 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.4. Although you may be few and weak in your selves, yet you may <hi>be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his Might, Eph.</hi> 6.10. You have the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Gods Might on your side; and <hi>if we Fall</hi> (saith <hi>Luther) Christ Falls.</hi>

St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls his Fight, a good Fight; he commended it for a good Fight, <hi>when he had finished his Course,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. Notwithstanding all his Stripes and Nakedness, his Imprisonments, Poverty, and Persecution, when ready to be offered up and beheaded, he commends it for a good Fight of Faith. When <hi>Polycarpus</hi> had served long under Christs Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and was come to <hi>Martrydom,</hi> saith he, <hi>I have been a servant of Christ these Eighty six years, and I have alwayes found him a good Master.</hi> The true followers of Christ, have always commended his Service. A sharp Fight, a bloody Fight, and yet a good Fight; hard Service, and yet good Service,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:204446:115"/> and a good Master. It was a notable saying of <hi>John Mallet,</hi> a Soldier of the Emperor of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, We have often hazarded our Lives for the Emperor</hi> Charles <hi>the Fifth, and shall we now shrink to die for the King of Kings?

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> Sixteenth Consideration. That notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the hardships you endure, and all the hazards, dangers and deaths that you live among, yet you are immortal until your time is come, and your work is finished. There was no taking off the life of Christ Jesus the Captain of your Salvation, until his time was come. Oh the many dangers that <hi>Paul</hi> was in! and yet he finished his Course, and finished his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, and did his Work. History tells us of Saint <hi>John,</hi> that he was cast into a Tun of scald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lead by <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperor, and was by way of Miracle delivered, and afterward ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished into the Isle of <hi>Patmos;</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all his dangers, he lived till very old age, and died at last a natural death. So we read <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.7. <hi>That the Witnesses could not be slain until they had finished their Testimony;</hi> they first finished their testimony and witness.</p>
            <p>We read of one that was specially aimed at in that bloody Massacre in <hi>France,</hi> who crept into some little hole to preserve himself; and was no sooner in, but in a very short space a Spider had made a Web before the hole, where the bloody pursuers coming to search, seeing the Web, they concluded he could not be there; and by that means he escaped their hands.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:204446:116"/> Christians, what encouragement is this? the Lord hath unknown ways to protect and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in the midst of all your dangers, until your time is come, and your work is done.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> Seventeenth Consideration. It is your way to conquer, to endure hardness. The Captain of our Salvation he conquered by enduring; and so it is the way he hath left for all his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Followers, to get the victory and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, by keeping up the combat, and enduring hardness: Jesus Christ overcame by the blood of the Cross; and Christians have no way to overcome without bearing his Cross. It is said <hi>Rev.</hi> 12 11, <hi>And they overcame by the blood of the Lamb, and by the Word of their Testimony, and they loved not their lives unto the death.</hi> The Lamb overcame by his own blood, and the Saints overcome by the blood of the Lamb, in suffering for him; they overcome in holding fast their Testimony, and not loving their lives unto the death? The Apostle enumerating a great deal of hardness and sufferings, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. <hi>Nay,</hi> (saith he) <hi>in all these things we are more then Conquerors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ah Soldiers of Christ! this is your way to conquer, and to be more then Conquerors, to endure hardness. How notably doth <hi>Cyprian</hi> set forth the Victoriousness of the Saints in suffering the hardest things that could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on them. <q>The tormented stood stronger than the tormentors; the beaten and butchered members overcame the hands that did beat and butcher them; cruel stripes oft repeated, long continued, could not
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:204446:116"/> overcome their impregnable Faith, no not though their bowels were digged out, and not so much the members, as the wounds of the Servants of the Lord were tormented; their blood gushed out, which even quenched the burning of persecution, yea, extinguished the flames and fire of Hell, with a glorious stream.</q>

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:204446:117"/> Lord Jesus, the Captain of our Salvation, was once Wounded and Pierced with the Spear of the Enemy, and his Hands and Feet nailed to the Cross; but now these Wounds are healed, and his Body most perfect in Glory; and so shall the Bodies of the Saints be fashioned, and made like unto his glorious body: It is the Will of the Father, that it should be so. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39. <hi>And this is the Fathers will that sent me, that of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.</hi> Jesus Christ will lose nothing of his Soldiers, not the least member of their bodies; no not so much as an hair of their heads, but will raise it up all in perfection and glory at last.</p>
            <p>The enemies that wound and kill the Saints, are a means to hasten them to a perfect cure of all their imperfections: And hereupon <hi>Hugh Laverock,</hi> an old lame man, comforted himself, and <hi>John ap Rice</hi> his fellow Martyr, a blind man, when they were at the stake, <hi>Be of good comfort my Brother,</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> Nineteenth Consideration. That it is better to endure hardness in Christs service, than to endure hardness for sin. Better to suffer as a Martyr for well-doing, than as a Malefactor for evil-doing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15, 16. <hi>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evil doer, or as a busie-body in other mens matters. Yet if any man suffer as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian let him not be ashamed, but let him glorifie God on this behalf.</hi> There is cause of shame, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:204446:117"/> cause of sorrow in suffering for sin, but there is cause of comfort and rejoicing in suffering for Christ. The torments that <hi>Cranmer, Bain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and others had in their Consciences for recanting, was far worse than the torment of the fire at the Stake, which afterward they did comfortably endure.</p>
            <p>Suffering for sin, how doth that sink the Spirits, and apale the countenance, and puts the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that tender part, upon the Wrack, and turns it into a very Hell of Torments! How dreadfully and desparately did <hi>Francis Spira</hi> lament, that ever he should wave suffering for Christs Truth and Cause, to suffer so much as he did for his <hi>Apostasie!</hi> he was, as it were, in Hell upon Earth, with the Torment of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and if there were any worse Hell behind, (he said) he longed for nothing more, than to know the worst and height of his Misery.</p>
            <p>They that read the Lamentable Story of this poor Despairing Creature, will easily conclude, That it is better to endure hardness for Christ, than for Sin. And when men do wave the Service of Christ, for the hardness of it, he will make them to endure hardness for their Sin, whether they will or no. One <hi>Denton,</hi> in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> days, answered a Christian Friend of his acquaintance, That those were the truths of God which he had formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto him; but (said he) <hi>I cannot burn:</hi> But in some few daies after, his House being on fire, he was burned in it. And is it not better to burn at a Stake for Christ, than to burn in our Houses for our Sin? There is cause of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:204446:118"/> Shame, and Sorrow, and Repentance, in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Sin; but there is cause of boldness, of glorying, and rejoycing in suffering for Christ.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Twentieth Consideration: That Persecuted Godliness, is better than Prosperous Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and the worst of Sufferings, is better than the best of Sin. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26. <hi>Moses</hi> preferred <hi>the Reproaches of Christ,</hi> and Sufferings for Christ, before all the Pleasures, Riches, Pomp and Splendor of <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Court; he accounted, that there were better Pleasures, better Riches and Honours in suffering for Christ with the people of God, than <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Court could afford; and surely accounted right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and there upon made that blessed choice.</p>
            <p>The more we suffer for Christ, the more may we expect of the Presence of Christ, of the Consolations of Christ, of Communion with Christ; and <hi>one days Communion with Jesus Christ</hi> (saith <hi>Galiacius) is better than all the World.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Look at, and seriously consider the hardness and misery that the Damned en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and suffer, for denying, and disowning of the service of Christ.

What was the Material Fire which consumed the Bodies of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> to ashes; to the fire of Hell, the flames of Gods revenging Wrath, which shall always torment, but never consume.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O</hi> (said <hi>Hyperius) what a difference is there betwixt this, and Eternal Fire? who would shun this, to leap into that?</hi> This is but the Fire that men do kindle, but the other is the Fire that <hi>the breath of the Lord, like a stream of Brimstone, doth kindle, Isa.</hi> 30.33.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Look at the Invisible God, and the Invisible things of the other World. Get up to the top of <hi>Pisgah,</hi> and view the Holy Land; of what precious use was this to <hi>Moses,</hi> to mount his spirit above the fear of what <hi>Pharoah</hi> could do, when enraged against him, and to endure Affliction, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. <hi>By Faith he forsook</hi> Egypt, <hi>not fearing the Wrath of the King; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</hi> When the showers of stones fell upon <hi>Stephen</hi> the Deacon, the Proto-Martyr,<note place="margin">Act. 7.55.56.</note>
               <hi>he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God;</hi> how little then did he regard the stones which malicious hands cast at him, or fear the near approach of the King of Terrors? Faith is an invisible eye, and it can see into another World, and it can fetch the comfort, the sweetness of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:204446:122"/> God, of Christ, of Heaven, upon Earth.</p>
            <p>What a Soul-strengthning, a Soul-chearing, and Heart-rejoycing prospect was that which <hi>Job</hi> took, to bear him up under all worldly Afflictions which he endured? <hi>Job</hi> 19 25, 26. <hi>For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the last day upon the Earth; and though after my skin, Worms destroy this body, yet in my Flesh shall I see God.</hi> How did the Apostle and the Primitive Christians, cordial and quiet their Spirits, and bear up themselves under all their variety of Afflictions and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16, 17, 18. They looked at <hi>the far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> at the unseen and eternal things; and whilst they took this prospect, they were kept from fainting and sinking. Jesus Christ the Captain of our Salvation, used this means himself, to bear himself up, and carry him through all the hardness and Affliction he met with in his Race that he ran. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Who for the joy that was set before him, endured the Cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of God.</hi> So the believing-<hi>Hebrews,</hi> looking at <hi>the better and more enduring substance they had in Heaven, they could take joyfully the spoyling of their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goods, Heb.</hi> 10.34.

It is no good argument that many use in these dayes, to justifie Apostasie, and waving of the Cross of the Lord, by sinful Compliance, to bring the examples of men, in such a manner: Why, (say they) it is the opinion of divers good men; and there be divers learned, and godly men do this, and that, and the other thing, and they must not be touched. But let men be never so godly, or learned, they have a dark-side, as well as a light, and it is no new thing even for such to shrink, and to pinch at the Cross. <hi>Peter</hi> must not be followed in his <hi>Apostasie,</hi> nor the <hi>Martyrs</hi> in their <hi>Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
